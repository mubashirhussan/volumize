          Hair loss, also known as alopecia, is a common condition that affects
          many people worldwide. It can occur for various reasons and can impact
          both men and women. Hair loss can be temporary or permanent and can
          have significant emotional and psychological effects on individuals.

              Many others provide finasteride in tablet form, which is taken
              whilst also using a Minoxidil topical solution. Our Treatment
              Spray combines both of these popular and tried-and-tested
              solutions into one topical head spray. Because our Treatment Spray
              is not ingested and the treatment is applied directly to the
              source, the potential side effects are minimal and the treatment
              has an increased success rate.

              Yes, the Treatment Spray is suitable for restoring hairlines. We
              recommend applying it to the most affected areas and then
              massaging across the whole scalp. You will benefit from hair
              growth in the areas required, and overall thicker hair throughout.

              While hair transplants may appear like the be all and end all
              solution, unfortunately they are not as permanent as they sound.
              They require regular maintenance, often with the aid of Minoxidil
              and Finasteride which are the solutions combined in our Treatment
              Spray. Therefore even if you were to get a hair transplant, you
              would likely end up using a similar solution!

              provides the scalp the correct amount of solution designed for

              An unlicensed medicine can be defined in several ways: - A
              medicine that is formulated in an alternative version to the
              licensed medicine (e.g., a oral medication made into a topical
              liquid formulation, or a medication made in a different strength
              to the original licensed version). - A medicine that has no
              licence at all. - A medicine that has a licence in other
              countries, but not the UK. Our Topical Spray is an unlicensed
              treatment that contains 7% w/v minoxidil and 0.14% w/v Finasteride
              which is manufactured by a fully regulated and MHRA manufacturing
              site. 5% topical minoxidil and 1mg oral Finasteride are both
              licensed for the treatment of male hair loss. Our unique
              formulation combines both ingredients into a topical combination
              containing both products and therefore it is classified as an
              “unlicensed” medicine.
